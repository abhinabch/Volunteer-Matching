# Volunteer-Matching
This prototype website would allow those coming into Highschool to find close and local volunteering opportunities for those who need clarification on the requirements and what is close to them is available.
Using the Google Maps API, it is able to display the local volunteering building and the opportunities they hold.
For example, in NYC it would display three local buildings holding volunteering events and would display detailed about such event upon hover.
